// en a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

// Example 1:

// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q) {
  if (!root) {
    return null;
  }

  if (root === p || root === q) {
    return root;
  }

  let left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  let right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

  if (left && right) {
    return root;
  }

  if (left) {
    return left;
  }

  return right;
}
